name: Tuna Nicoise
description: A slight update on the classic recipe, but it's been a consistent, solid performer.  If you have capers lying around, add them to tuna mixture.
servings: Serves 2
ingredients:
    - 1/2 lemon
    - 1 cup arugula
    - 1 tbsp. olive oil
    - 1/3 cup pitted Kalamata olives, diced

    - 4 large cloves garlic, minced
    - 1 tsp. salt
